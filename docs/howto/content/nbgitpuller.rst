================================================
Distributing materials to users with nbgitpuller
================================================

Goal
====

A very common need when using JupyterHub is to easily
distribute study materials / lab notebooks to students.

Students should be able to:

1. Easily get the latest version of materials, including any updates the instructor
   has made to materials the student already has a copy of.
2. Be confident they won't lose any of their work. If an instructor has modified
   something the student has also modified, the student's modification should
   never be overwritten.
3. Not have to deal with manual merge conflicts or other complex operations.

Instructors should be able to:

1. Use modern collaborative version control tools to author & store their
   materials. This currently means using Git.

**nbgitpuller** is a Jupyter Notebook extension that helps achieve these goals.
This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating a magic
nbgitpuller link that users of your JupyterHub can click to fetch the latest
version of materials from a git repo.

Pre-requisites
==============

1. A JupyterHub set up with The Littlest JupyterHub
2. A git repository containing materials to distribute

Step 1: Generate nbgitpuller link
=================================

**Generate the link with a Binder app**.

#. The easiest way to generate an nbgitpuller link is to use the
   `mybinder.org based application <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller/master?urlpath=apps/binder%2Flink_generator.ipynb>`_.
   Open it, and wait for it to load.

#. A blank form with some help text will open up.

   .. image:: ../../images/nbgitpuller/blank-application.png

#. Enter the IP address or URL to your JupyterHub under ``hub_url``.
   Include ``http://`` or ``https://`` as appropriate.

   .. image:: ../../images/nbgitpuller/hub-url-application.png
      :alt: Application with hub_url filled out

#. Enter the URL to your Git repository. This could be from GitHub,
   GitLab or any other git provider - including the disk of the
   server The Littlest JupyterHub is installed on. As you start
   typing the URL here, you'll notice that the link is already
   being printed below!

   .. image:: ../../images/nbgitpuller/git-url-application.png
      :alt: Application with git_url filled out

#. If your git repository is using a non-default branch name,
   you can specify that under ``branch``. Most people do not
   need to customize this.

#. If you want to open a specific notebook when the user clicks
   on the link, specify the path to the notebook under ``filepath``.
   Make sure this file exists, otherwise users will get a 'File not found'
   error.

   .. image:: ../../images/nbgitpuller/filepath-application.png
      :alt: Application with filepath filled out

   If you do not specify a file path, the user will be shown the
   directory listing for the repository.

#. By default, notebooks will be opened in the classic Jupyter Notebook
   interface. You can select ``lab`` under ``application`` to open it in the
   `JupyterLab <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab>`_ instead.

The link printed at the bottom of the form can be distributed to students
now! You can also click it to test that it is working as intended,
and adjust the form values until you get something you are happy with.

**Hand-craft your nbgitpuller link**

If you'd prefer to hand-craft your ``nbgitpuller`` link (e.g. if the Binder
link above doesn't work), you can use the following pattern::

   http://<my-jhub-address>/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=<your-repo-url>&branch=<your-branch-name>&subPath=<subPath>&app=<notebook | lab>

- **repo** is the URL of the git repository you want to clone. This parameter is required.
- **branch** is the branch name to use when cloning from the repository.
  This parameter is optional and defaults to ``master``.
- **subPath** is the path of the directory / notebook inside the repo to launch after cloning.
  This parameter is optional, and defaults to opening the base directory of the linked Git repository.
- **app** This parameter is optional and defaults to either the environment variable
  `NBGITPULLER_APP`'s value or `notebook` if it is undefined. The allowed values
  are `lab` and `notebook`, the value will determine in what application view
  you end up in.
- **urlPath** will, if specified, override `app` and `subPath` and redirect
  blindly to the specified path.

Step 2: Users click on the nbgitpuller link
===========================================

#. Send the link to your users in some way - email, slack, post a
   shortened version (with `bit.ly <https://bit.ly>`_ maybe) on the wall, or
   put it on your syllabus page (like `UC Berkeley's data8 does <http://data8.org/sp18/>`_).
   Whatever works for you :)

#. When users click the link, they will be asked to log in to the hub
   if they have not already.

#. Users will see a progress bar as the git repository is fetched & any
   automatic merging required is performed.

   .. image:: ../../images/nbgitpuller/pull-progress.png
      :alt: Progress bar with git repository being pulled

#. Users will now be redirected to the notebook specified in the URL!

This workflow lets users land directly in the notebook you specified
without having to understand much about git or the JupyterHub interface.
